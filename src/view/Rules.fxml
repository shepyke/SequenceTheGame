If there are more than three individual players, they should divide evenly into two or three teams (up to three teams of 2 players).&#10;&#10;The number of cards dealt to each player varies by the number of people playing:&#10;&#10;Two Players: Five cards each&#10;Three Players: Five cards each&#10;Four Players: Five cards each&#10;Six Players: Five cards each&#10;Each card is pictured twice on the game board, and Jacks (while necessary for game strategy) do not appear on the board.&#10;&#10;Choose a card from your hand, and place a chip on one of the corresponding spaces of the game board (Example: you choose Ace of Diamonds from your hand and place a chip on the Ace of Diamonds on the board). Jacks are wild. Two-Eyed Jacks can represent any card and may be used to place a counter on any space on the board. One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent’s token from a space. Players may use the Two-Eyed Jacks to complete a row or block an opponent, and One-Eyed Jacks can remove an opponent’s advantage. However, One-Eyed Jacks cannot be used to remove a marker chip that is already part of a completed sequence. Once a sequence is achieved by a player or team, it stands. Once a Jack is played, it ends the turn.&#10;&#10;The played card then goes face-up into a “Discard” pile, and play passes to the left.&#10;&#10;A player may place chips on either of the appropriate card spaces as long as it is not already covered by an opponent’s marker chip.&#10;&#10;If a player possesses a card which does not have an open space on the game board, the card is considered “dead” and may be exchanged for a new card. When it is your turn, place the dead on card on the discard pile, announce you are turning in a dead card, and take a replacement (one card per turn). Then proceed to play your normal turn.&#10;&#10;Strategy&#10;Each corner of the board has a “Free” space that all players can use to their advantage. This space acts as if it has a chip of each color on it at all times - chips are never actually placed on this space.&#10;&#10;To form rows, poker chips may be placed vertically, horizontally or diagonally. Each complete row of five (or four and a free corner space) is counted as a sequence. Sequences of the same color may intersect, but only at a single position.&#10;&#10;If the draw deck becomes depleted during play, shuffle the discard pile and begin again.&#10;&#10;Sequence rules dictate no table talk or coaching between team members and a precise order in which hands must be played (card, chip, replace card). If you forget to replace a card on your turn, you cannot make it up in a later one and must continue playing the game with a reduced number of cards.&#10;&#10;Winning&#10;The game ends when a player completes the winning amount of sequences: two sequences for two players or teams; one sequence for three players or teams.&#10;&#10;Two Sequences: When two (2) sequences are required to win they can be in one straight row of ten chips. However this is accepted as a win only when one sequence does not interrupt the other. Once a sequence is made in the middle of the line it disrupts the ends. For example 5+4 is acceptable but a 2+5+3 is unacceptable." wrapText="true" />
